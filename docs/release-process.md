# 🚀 How to release

- Branch requirement: run releases only from the `master` branch. The script enforces this and exits otherwise.

1. Run `./scripts/release <VERSION>` to create a new version
2. Go to GitHub Actions to monitor the build process
3. Once complete, update and publish the release on GitHub
